	<h1>Lab Assignment / Assignment #2</h1>
	<h2>Question 1:  From examining the display in your web browser and the structure of  
	the source code in the page, what effect (if any) does the white space 
	(i.e. tabs, blank lines, multiple spaces) have on what is displayed in the browser?</h2>
	<p>answer: The tabs and extra spaces mean nothing in the code lines other than to break up the commands visually.  
	
	<h2>Question 2:  How are the

    h1
and

    h2 
elements from the source code displayed differently in the browser?</p> </h2>
	<p>answer:  These commands change the size of the text that is displayed to the screen.</p>
	<h2>Question3:  What type of element would you use to create additional list elements in either the 
	“topic” or “data type” lists on the page.</h2>
	<p>answer:  You would use a tag element such as table or a text tag.</p>
