	<h2>Question 1:  From examining the display in your web browser and the structure of  
	the source code in the page, what effect (if any) does the white space 
	(i.e. tabs, blank lines, multiple spaces) have on what is displayed in the browser?</h2>
	<p>answer: The tabs and spaces mean nothing in the code lines other than to break up the commands visually.  
	They do begin to make a difference in what is displayed when they are in a string that is to be printed to the screen.
	<h2>Question 2:  How are the

    <h1>
and

    <h2> 
elements from the source code displayed differently in the browser?</p> </h2>
	<p>answer:  These commands change the size of the text that is displayed to the screen.</p>
	<h2>Question:  What type of element would you use to create additional list elements in either the 
	“topic” or “data type” lists on the page.</h2>
